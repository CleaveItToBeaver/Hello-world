# Hello-world
A testbed for the very basics

Aiming for a simple, GURPS-like combat and skill system.

Next goals on the chopping block:\n
	*Loop variation - next combatant, town functions\n
	*HT-based Death checks\n
	*Stun\n
	*Attack Options\n
	*Defensive Options\n
	*Treasure tables
	[X]*"Training" - purchasing CP with accumulated silver
	[X]*Advancement - upgrading stats with CP
	*Skill implementation
	*Conditions (prone, wounded, etc)
	*Limbs?
	*Dungeon Generation + exploration loop using roll(skill) function
	*Inventory system - probably a dict[] or list referencing class instances?
