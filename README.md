# Hello-world
A testbed for the very basics

Aiming for a simple, GURPS-like combat and skill system.

Main game file (skillRoll.py) needs to share the same directory as the accompanying .txt files to load gear and enemies properly. Make sure the call to start() is not commented at the bottom of the file in order to launch in a console (comment with a leading # to debug).

Next goals on the chopping block:

	[X]*Loop variation - next combatant, town functions
	
	[X]*HT-based Death checks
	
	*Stun
	
	[X]*Attack Options
	
	*Defensive Options
	
	*Treasure tables
	
	[X]*"Training" - purchasing CP with accumulated silver 
	
	[X]*Advancement - upgrading stats with CP
	
	*Skill implementation
	
	*Conditions (prone, wounded, etc)
	
	*Limbs?
	
	*Dungeon Generation + exploration loop using roll(skill) function
	
	[X]*Inventory system - probably a dict[] or list referencing class instances?
	
	*Randomized arena enemy loadouts
