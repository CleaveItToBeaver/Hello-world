# Hello-world
A testbed for the very basics

Aiming for a simple, GURPS-like combat and skill system.

Next goals on the chopping block:
	*Loop variation - next combatant, town functions
	*HT-based Death checks
	*Stun and shock-modifiers
	*Attack Options
	*Defensive Options
	*Basic loot (as silver pieces)
	*"Training" - purchasing CP with accumulated silver
	*Advancement - upgrading stats with CP
	*Skill implementation
	*Conditions (prone, wounded, etc)
	*Limbs?
	*Dungeon Generation + exploration loop using roll(skill) function
	*Inventory system - probably a dict[]?
